A Java API for Measuring Document Similarity.

Due to unforseen circumstances over Christmas I didn't quite get this project completed, Although I think I have most of it done.

My API consists of 8 classes, varying from a simple runner class to a menu, parser, consumer and shingle.

I have included a screenshot of my UML diagram in my submission and also a Jar file.
I have pushed this project to GITHUB and the link to the repository is: https://github.com/DamianGavin/Java-API-for-measuring-document-similarity.git
